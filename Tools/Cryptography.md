Fernet gives a high‑level way to encrypt and authenticate data, while the hazmat APIs expose the low‑level cryptographic building blocks that Fernet (and many other protocols) are built on.

Hazmats provide:
- Low‑level primitives: ciphers (AES, ChaCha20), hashes (SHA2, SHA3), MACs (HMAC), KDFs (PBKDF2, HKDF, scrypt), and asymmetric algorithms
-
